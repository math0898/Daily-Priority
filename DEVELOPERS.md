# Daily Priority

Daily priority is a task managing program meant to be run from terminal. From there users can add tasks to their day at a specific priority and set the bar for what is considered a good day of progress on the task list.

## Approach

This project is written in C++ with perhaps a few segments that could be considered 'C code' but still the project takes a very object orientated approach outside of `int main()`. That is unfortunately a result of my experience with Java but unlike Java I'm using pointers to help optimize memory where ever possible. Additionally since there isn't a need for a JVM, in theory the program runs faster too.
